**`Digital Craftsman (Junior Developer/Student)`**

Hello, my name is Julian, Iâ€™m a student at 42 Luxembourg, where Iâ€™m passionate about coding, problem-solving, and collaborating on exciting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Letâ€™s learn and grow together!

## ðŸ§° Languages & Tools

I've been using C, C++, Bash and Linux almost everyday at school for the past few months.

At my previous work as a Junior Web Developer, I was using Angular and TypeScript for the front-end and .NET framework with a MSSQL database for the back-end.

I did side projects using my Raspberry Pi:
- Private VPN Network
- Self-hosted Password Manager
- PiHole (Router level ad-blocker)

Recently, I've discovered the world of Blockchain and Defi. Me and my classmates even won the 1st prize of a Web3 Hackathon in Luxembourg.<br>
That's why I've started working and learning Ethereum and Solidity.
